A brief explanation of the model;

A PDG is a directed graph that represents the control flow of a program.
It is composed of multiple PDGNodes. Each node can be either a CFG Node, represented by a Block, or a Region, represented by a Region NOde.
A Block consits of multiple units, where a unit is a single statement or expression.
